# System Patterns: Company Management System

*(This document will outline the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships, and critical implementation paths as they are defined.)*

## 1. Overall Architecture

*(To be defined. Will likely involve a web application architecture, potentially microservices if complexity warrants it, but given the cost constraints, a well-structured monolith might be preferred initially.)*

*   Reference Diagram: `../diagrams/architecture.puml` (To be created)
*   Generated Diagram: `../generated-diagrams/architecture.png` (To be created)

## 2. Key Technical Decisions

*(To be documented as decisions are made, e.g., database choice, backend framework, frontend framework, authentication method.)*

## 3. Design Patterns

*(To be documented as patterns are implemented, e.g., Repository Pattern for data access, MVC/MVVM for UI structure.)*

## 4. Component Relationships (Initial Focus: Cost Management)

*(To be defined. How does the Cost Management module interact with potential future modules like User Management, Reporting, etc.?)*

## 5. Critical Implementation Paths

*(To be identified. E.g., Secure handling of financial data, efficient reporting queries.)*
