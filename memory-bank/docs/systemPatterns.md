# System Patterns: Company Management System

*(This document will outline the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships, and critical implementation paths as they are defined.)*

## 1. Overall Architecture

*   **Chosen Architecture:** **Modular Monolith**.
*   **Rationale:** Balances initial development speed and cost-effectiveness with future scalability. The application will be built as a single deployable unit but internally structured into distinct modules (e.g., Cost Management, User Management) to facilitate potential future separation into microservices if needed.
*   **Flow:** Frontend (React) communicates with Backend (NestJS) via REST APIs. Backend handles business logic and interacts with the PostgreSQL database.

## 2. Key Technical Decisions

*(To be documented as decisions are made, e.g., database choice, backend framework, frontend framework, authentication method.)*

## 3. Design Patterns

*(To be documented as patterns are implemented, e.g., Repository Pattern for data access, MVC/MVVM for UI structure.)*

## 4. Component Relationships (Initial Focus: Cost Management)

*(To be defined. How does the Cost Management module interact with potential future modules like User Management, Reporting, etc.?)*

## 5. Critical Implementation Paths

*(To be identified. E.g., Secure handling of financial data, efficient reporting queries.)*
