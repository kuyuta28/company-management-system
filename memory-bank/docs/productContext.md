# Product Context: Company Management System

## 1. Why This Project?

The primary driver for this project is the need for improved internal operational efficiency and financial visibility within the company. Currently, processes like expense tracking might be manual, time-consuming, or lack centralized oversight.

The CEO specifically requires a clear view of company expenditures to make informed financial decisions.

## 2. Problem Solved

This system aims to solve:

*   Lack of centralized tracking for company expenses.
*   Difficulty in analyzing spending patterns across different categories or time periods.
*   Time spent on manual data entry and report generation for expenses.
*   Potential inaccuracies in expense data due to manual processes.

## 3. How It Should Work (Initial Focus: Cost Management)

*   **Users (e.g., Finance, Staff):** Can easily log new expenses with relevant details (amount, date, category, vendor, description, attachments).
*   **System:** Categorizes expenses based on predefined rules or user input. Stores expense data securely.
*   **Users (e.g., CEO, Finance, Managers):** Can view dashboards and generate reports summarizing expenses by various dimensions (category, department, project, time).
*   **(Future):** Implement approval workflows, budget comparisons, and potentially integrate with accounting software.

## 4. User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive:** Easy for users to log expenses quickly and accurately.
*   **Informative:** Provide clear, actionable insights into spending patterns through reports and dashboards.
*   **Efficient:** Reduce the manual effort required for expense management and reporting.
*   **Accessible:** Allow authorized users to access relevant expense information easily.

*(This context will evolve as requirements are further defined.)*
