# Product Context: Company Management System

## 1. Why This Project?

The primary driver for this project is the need for improved internal operational efficiency and financial visibility within the company. Currently, processes like expense tracking might be manual, time-consuming, or lack centralized oversight.

The CEO specifically requires a clear view of company expenditures to make informed financial decisions.

## 2. Problem Solved

This system aims to solve:

*   Lack of centralized tracking for company expenses.
*   Difficulty in analyzing spending patterns across different categories or time periods.
*   Time spent on manual data entry and report generation for expenses.
*   Potential inaccuracies in expense data due to manual processes.

## 3. How It Should Work (Initial Focus: Cost Management)

*   **Data Entry:** Users (Finance, Staff depending on permissions) can log expenses including: Date, Amount, Currency, Category, Vendor/Payee, Description, Payment Method, and optionally attach receipts. Project/Department can be linked if needed.
*   **Categorization:** The system uses a predefined, but extensible, list of expense categories.
*   **Status Tracking:** Expenses will have statuses (e.g., New, Pending Approval, Approved, Paid, Rejected).
*   **Approval Workflow (Initial):** A simple workflow will be implemented. Expenses below a certain threshold entered by authorized users might bypass approval. Others require approval from a Manager or Finance, triggering notifications.
*   **Reporting:** Basic reports will be available: total expenses by time period, expenses by category, expenses by payment method, and a filterable list of all expenses.
*   **User Roles:** Defined roles (Admin, Finance, Manager, Employee) will control access to data entry, approval, and reporting features.
*   **Security:** Expense data will be stored securely.

## 4. User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive:** Easy for users to log expenses quickly and accurately.
*   **Informative:** Provide clear, actionable insights into spending patterns through reports and dashboards.
*   **Efficient:** Reduce the manual effort required for expense management and reporting.
*   **Accessible:** Allow authorized users to access relevant expense information easily.

*(This context will evolve as requirements are further defined.)*
