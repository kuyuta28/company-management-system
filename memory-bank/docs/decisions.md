**Date:** [Date of Scope Shift - e.g., 2025-04-08]

*   **Decision:** Shift project's initial focus from "Funding Source Management" to "Cost/Expenditure Management".
*   **Context:** Initial request was to plan for managing funding sources. CEO clarification indicated the primary need is to understand and track company spending.
*   **Options Considered:**
    1.  Proceed with funding source management as initially requested.
    2.  Pivot to focus on expenditure management based on CEO's clarified priority.
*   **Rationale:** Directly addresses the CEO's stated primary need for visibility into company spending. Building the expenditure module first provides more immediate value based on the clarified requirements. Funding source management can be considered as a future module if needed.
