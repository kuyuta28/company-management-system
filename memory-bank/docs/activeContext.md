# Active Context: Company Management System

## Current Work Focus

*   **Phase:** Project Planning & Requirements Gathering.
*   **Module:** Cost Management Module.
*   **Activity:** Initial detailed requirements for the Cost Management module have been defined and agreed upon. Memory Bank setup completed.

## Recent Changes / Decisions

*   **Shift in Focus:** The initial request to track funding sources has been clarified and shifted to focus on tracking company **expenditures (costs)**.
*   **Memory Bank:** Initiated the creation of the Memory Bank structure and core documentation files.

## Next Steps

1.  Develop a detailed implementation plan (tasks, estimates) for the Cost Management module (v0.1) based on the chosen tech stack (NestJS, React, PostgreSQL) and Modular Monolith architecture.
2.  Start database schema design for PostgreSQL, focusing on the Cost Management module entities.
3.  Set up the initial project structure for both backend (NestJS) and frontend (React).
4.  Configure basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions (linting, unit tests initially).

## Active Considerations / Questions

*   Refine the simple approval workflow logic (e.g., specific threshold amount, notification mechanism).
*   Define specific API endpoints needed for the Cost Management module based on frontend requirements.
*   Choose a UI component library for React to speed up frontend development (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI).

## Important Patterns / Preferences

*   Adhere to `.clinerules/` guidelines (Clean Code, Code Quality, Development, CEO Rules, Tech Lead Rules, etc.).
*   Prioritize solutions leveraging internal team capabilities and minimizing external costs (as per `important.CEO_rules.md`).
*   Maintain comprehensive documentation in the Memory Bank.

## Learnings / Insights

*   Initial project scope needs careful clarification. The focus shifted significantly from funding sources to expenditures based on CEO input.
