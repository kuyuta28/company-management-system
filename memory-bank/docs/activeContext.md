# Active Context: Company Management System

## Current Work Focus

*   **Phase:** Project Planning & Requirements Gathering.
*   **Module:** Cost Management Module.
*   **Activity:** Initial detailed requirements for the Cost Management module have been defined and agreed upon. Memory Bank setup completed.

## Recent Changes / Decisions

*   **Shift in Focus:** The initial request to track funding sources has been clarified and shifted to focus on tracking company **expenditures (costs)**.
*   **Memory Bank:** Initiated the creation of the Memory Bank structure and core documentation files.

## Next Steps

1.  Define the system architecture and technology stack based on agreed requirements and constraints.
2.  Develop a detailed implementation plan (tasks, estimates) for the Cost Management module (v0.1).
3.  Start database schema design.

## Active Considerations / Questions

*   Need to decide on specific technologies (Backend framework, Frontend framework, Database) considering cost and team expertise.
*   Need to refine the simple approval workflow logic (e.g., specific threshold amount).

## Important Patterns / Preferences

*   Adhere to `.clinerules/` guidelines (Clean Code, Code Quality, Development, CEO Rules, Tech Lead Rules, etc.).
*   Prioritize solutions leveraging internal team capabilities and minimizing external costs (as per `important.CEO_rules.md`).
*   Maintain comprehensive documentation in the Memory Bank.

## Learnings / Insights

*   Initial project scope needs careful clarification. The focus shifted significantly from funding sources to expenditures based on CEO input.
