# Active Context: Company Management System

## Current Work Focus

*   **Phase:** Project Planning & Requirements Gathering.
*   **Module:** Cost Management Module.
*   **Activity:** Defining detailed requirements for the Cost Management module based on CEO's need to track company expenditures. Initial Memory Bank setup is in progress.

## Recent Changes / Decisions

*   **Shift in Focus:** The initial request to track funding sources has been clarified and shifted to focus on tracking company **expenditures (costs)**.
*   **Memory Bank:** Initiated the creation of the Memory Bank structure and core documentation files.

## Next Steps

1.  Complete the creation of the initial Memory Bank structure and core files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisions.md`).
2.  Gather detailed requirements for the Cost Management module (based on the questions asked in PLAN MODE).
3.  Define the system architecture and technology stack.
4.  Develop a detailed implementation plan for the Cost Management module (v0.1).

## Active Considerations / Questions

*   Need detailed answers to the requirement clarification questions regarding cost management (categories, details per expense, approval process, reporting needs, user roles, integrations, budget tracking).

## Important Patterns / Preferences

*   Adhere to `.clinerules/` guidelines (Clean Code, Code Quality, Development, CEO Rules, Tech Lead Rules, etc.).
*   Prioritize solutions leveraging internal team capabilities and minimizing external costs (as per `important.CEO_rules.md`).
*   Maintain comprehensive documentation in the Memory Bank.

## Learnings / Insights

*   Initial project scope needs careful clarification. The focus shifted significantly from funding sources to expenditures based on CEO input.
