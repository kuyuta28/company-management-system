# Technical Context: Company Management System

*(This document will detail the technologies used, development setup guidelines, technical constraints, dependencies, and specific tool usage patterns.)*

## 1. Technologies Used

*   **Backend Language/Framework:** (To be decided - e.g., Java/Spring Boot, Python/Django, Node.js/Express)
*   **Frontend Language/Framework:** (To be decided - e.g., TypeScript/React, Angular, Vue)
*   **Database:** (To be decided - e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB - Consider cost and team expertise)
*   **API Style:** (Likely REST, following `.clinerules/agent.API-standards-template.md`)
*   **Authentication:** (To be decided - e.g., JWT, Session-based)
*   **Containerization:** (Likely Docker, as per `.clinerules/agent.README-template.md`)
*   **Deployment/Orchestration:** (To be decided - Consider team capability vs cost, e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, simpler VM deployment)
*   **Testing Frameworks:** (To be decided based on language choices - Adhere to `.clinerules/development-guidelines.md`)

## 2. Development Setup

*(To be defined. Will include instructions for setting up the local development environment, required tools, environment variables, etc.)*

## 3. Technical Constraints

*   **Cost Minimization:** Prioritize open-source technologies and solutions that minimize external operational costs (SaaS subscriptions, managed cloud services where self-hosting is viable). Leverage internal team capabilities for management.
*   **Team Capability:** Assume a strong internal technical team capable of managing infrastructure and learning new technologies.
*   **Security:** Implement standard security best practices for web applications, especially concerning financial data.
*   **Scalability:** While starting potentially as a monolith, design with future scalability in mind (e.g., modular design).

## 4. Dependencies

*(To be listed as external libraries or services are chosen.)*

## 5. Tool Usage Patterns

*   **Version Control:** Git, following Gitflow strategy (`.clinerules/agent.gitflow.md`).
*   **Code Quality:** Adhere to Clean Code (`.clinerules/agent.clean-code.md`) and Code Quality (`.clinerules/agent.codequality.md`) guidelines.
*   **CI/CD:** (To be defined - Tool choice depends on cost/preference, e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
*   **Documentation:** Maintain Memory Bank rigorously. Use PlantUML for diagrams.
